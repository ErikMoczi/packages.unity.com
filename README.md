Unity Analytics Standard Events take the guesswork out of tracking key game events, which makes adding deep analytics to your game insanely simple.

Standard Events serve as an easy-to-follow checklist of the most important elements to track in your game. For example, use tutorial events to track onboarding, and to better understand the first-time user experience...then compare that to Day 1 retention to see not just what is happening in your game, but also to understand why.

Easily implement Standard Events through code using a well-documented, type-safe API that supports Intellisense. Alternatively, the included Analytics Event Tracker component can be used to quickly and easily add both standard and custom events to your game, all without writing any code!

Standard Events is a feature of Unity Analytics, and requires the Unity Analytics service to be enabled.
