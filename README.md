This Project Template utilzes the Lightweight Render Pipeline. 

It is a great starting point for users targeting a broad range of mobile platforms, low-end to mid-tier hardware, or for developers making games that have limited realtime lighting needs. 

Beyond being tuned for the Lightweight Render Pipeline this project includes 
▪ Shadergraph 
▪ Post Processing V2 Stack  
▪ Presets 
▪ Example content
