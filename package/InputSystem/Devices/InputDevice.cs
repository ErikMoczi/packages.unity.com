////      (e.g. get gamepad input but do *not* get mouse and keyboard input)

////REVIEW: should be possible to completely hijack the input stream of a device such that its original input is suppressed

////REVIEW: can we construct the control tree of devices on demand so that the user never has to pay for
////        the heap objects of devices that aren't used?

//  - on remove (also resets current)
//
// Ideally, these would *not* be virtual methods on InputDevice but use a different process (which?)
