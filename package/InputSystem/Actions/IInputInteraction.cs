////TODO: add way for parameters on interactions and processors to be driven from global value source that is NOT InputSettings
////      (ATM it's very hard to e.g. have a scale value on gamepad stick bindings which is determined dynamically from player
////      settings in the game)

////REVIEW: what about putting an instance of one of these on every resolved control instead of sharing it between all controls resolved from a binding?

////REVIEW: can we have multiple interactions work together on the same binding? E.g. a 'Press' causing a start and a 'Release' interaction causing a performed

////REVIEW: have a default interaction so that there *always* is an interaction object when processing triggers?
