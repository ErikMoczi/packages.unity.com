        //       One good use case for groups is to mark up bindings that have a certain
        //       common meaning. Say, for example, you have a several binding chains
        //       (maybe even across different action sets) where the first binding in the
        //       chain always represents the same "modifier". Let's say it's the left
        //       trigger on the gamepad and it'll swap between a primary set of bindings
        //       on the four-button group on the gamepad and a secondary set. You could
