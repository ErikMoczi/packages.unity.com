////REVIEW: might have to revisit when we fire actions in relation to Update/FixedUpdate

////REVIEW: Do we need to have separate display names for actions? They should definitely be allowed to contain '/' and whatnot

////REVIEW: the entire 'lastXXX' API section is shit and needs a pass

////TODO: give every action in the system a stable unique ID; use this also to reference actions in InputActionReferences

////TODO: explore UnityEvents as an option to hook up action responses right in the inspector

////REVIEW: allow individual bindings to be enabled/disabled?

////TODO: event-based processing of input actions

////TODO: do not hardcode the transition from performed->waiting; allow an action to be performed over and over again inside
////      a single start cycle

////REVIEW: instead of only having the callbacks on each single action, also have them on the map as a whole?

// So, actions are set up to not have a contract. They just monitor state changes and then fire
// in response to those.
//
// However, as a user, this is only half the story I'm interested in. Yeah, I want to monitor
// state changes but I also want to control what values come in as a result.
//
// Actions don't carry values themselves. As such they don't have a value type. As a user, however,
// in by far most of the cases, I will think of an action as giving me a specific type of value.
// A "move" action, for example, is likely top represent a 2D planar motion vector. It can come from
// a gamepad thumbstick, from pointer deltas, or from a combination of keyboard keys (usually WASD).
// So the "move" action already has an aspect about it that's very much on my mind as a user but which
// is not represented anywhere in the action itself.
//
// There are probably cases where I want an action to be "polymorphic" but those I think are far and
// few between.
//
// Right now, actions just have a flat list of bindings. This works sufficiently well for bindings that
// are going to controls that already generate values that both match the expected value as well as
// the expected value *characteristics* (even with the right value type, if the value ranges and change
// rates are not what's expected, binding to a control may have undesired behavior).
//
// When bindings are supposed to work in unison (as with WASD, for example), a flat list of bindings
// is insufficient. A WASD setup is four distinct bindings that together form a single value. Also, even
// when bindings are independent, to properly work across devices of different types, it is often necessary
// to apply custom processing to values coming in through one binding and not to values coming in through
// a different binding.
//
// It is possible to offload all this responsibility to the code running in action callbacks but I think
// this will make for a very hard to use system at best. The promise of actions is that they abstract away
// from the types of devices being used. If actions are to live up to that promise, they need to be able
// to handle the above cases internally in their processing.
