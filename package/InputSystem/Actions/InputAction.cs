////REVIEW: should continuous actions *always* trigger as long as they are enabled? (even if no control is actuated)

////REVIEW: I think the action system as it is today offers too many ways to shoot yourself in the foot. It has
////        flexibility but at the same time has abundant opportunity for ending up with dysfunction. Common setups
////        have to come preconfigured and work robustly for the user without requiring much understanding of how
////        the system fits together.

////REVIEW: have single delegate instead of separate performed/started/cancelled callbacks?

////REVIEW: remove everything on InputAction that isn't about being an endpoint? (i.e. 'controls' and 'bindings')

////REVIEW: might have to revisit when we fire actions in relation to Update/FixedUpdate

////REVIEW: Do we need to have separate display names for actions? They should definitely be allowed to contain '/' and whatnot

////REVIEW: the entire 'lastXXX' API section is shit and needs a pass

////TODO: allow changing bindings without having to disable

////REVIEW: what about having the concept of "consumed" on the callback context?

////REVIEW: should actions basically be handles to data that is stored in an array in the map?
////        (with this, we could also implement more efficient duplication where we duplicate all the binding data but not the action data)

////REVIEW: have "Always Enabled" toggle on actions?

// An issue that has come up repeatedly is the request for having a polling-based API that allows actions to be used the same
// way UnityEngine.Input allows axes to be used. Here's my thoughts. While such an API is a bad fit for how actions operate,
// the request is definitely reasonable and a simple polling-based API could be created in a relatively straightforward way. It'd
// have to drop some details on the floor and do some aggregation of state, but where someone reaches the limits, there would always
// be a possible migration to the callback-based API.
//
// However, before launching into creating an entirely separate API to interface with actions, I would first like to try and see
// if something can be done to obsolete the need for it. The main obstacle with the callback-based API is that setting up and managing
// the callbacks is very tedious and requires a lot of duct tape. What if instead the setup was trivial and something you never have
// to worry about? Would the need for a polling-based API still be there? That's what I would like to find out first.
