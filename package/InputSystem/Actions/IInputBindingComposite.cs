    /// <remarks>
    /// Composites are useful for arranging controls on a given device in a way
    /// that is not present on the device itself. A keyboard, for example, has no
    /// inherent way of controlling a 2D planar motion vector, for example. However,
    /// a WASD-style key arrangement is commonly used to achieve just that kind of
    /// control.
    ///
    /// Composites join several controls together such that they ultimately deliver
    /// a single value.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <typeparam name="TValue">Type of value computed by the composite.</typeparam>
    /// <example>
    /// <code>
    /// // A composite that uses two buttons to emulate a radial dial control.
    /// // Yields values in degrees.
    /// class ButtonDialComposite : IInputBindingComposite<float>
    /// {
    ///     ////TODO
