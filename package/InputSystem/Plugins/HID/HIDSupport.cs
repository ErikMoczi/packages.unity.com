    /// controls into an InputDevice. It will make a best effort to figure
    /// out a suitable class for the device and will use the HID elements
    /// present in the HID report descriptor to populate the device.

    /// If there is an existing product-specific layout for a HID, it will
    /// take precedence and HIDSupport will leave the device alone.
