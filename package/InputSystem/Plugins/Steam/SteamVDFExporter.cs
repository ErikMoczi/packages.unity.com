////REVIEW: What we really want, I think, is a *layout* in the system that represents the device
////        with the actions being controls. Exporting InputActions to .VDF seems to not make much sense

namespace UnityEngine.Experimental.Input.Plugins.Steam
{
    // Exports an .inputactions asset into Steam .VDF format.
    public class SteamVDFExporter
    {
    }
}
