InputData is meant to become the new core of the system. It should present an almost entirely struct-based and jobified API. Eventually, the class-based APIs (InputControl, InputDevice, and InputAction) should become wrappers around what's going on in this system. Ideally, the class-based APIs would become optional and provided purely for convenience.
