## _2D Project Template_ ##

Configures Project settings for 2D apps, including Texture (Image) Import, Sprite Packer, Scene View, Lighting, and Orthographic Camera. Uses Unity's Built-in renderer.

This Project Template should be used for 2D games that use flat graphics, sometimes called sprites, which have no three-dimensional geometry at all. 
They are drawn to the screen as flat images, and the gameâ€™s camera has no perspective. 
 
 This project template is completely empty. It does not contain Post Processing, a Scriptable Render Pipeline or Shadergraph. It does not contain presets, or example content.
