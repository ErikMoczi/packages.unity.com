# Audio Module Reference

Tiny supports a subset of [Unity Audio](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioOverview.html) referred to as the Audio module. This document provides common use cases, an example, and a reference of Audio components.

## Use Cases and Examples

This section demonstrates how to use the Audio module through common use cases and usage examples. If a use case or an example is similar to a topic in the Unity User Manual, a link is provided to the appropriate topic.

### Simple Audio Source

1. Create an entity.
2. Add an [AudioSource](#audiosource) component.
3. Set the `clip` property to an audio asset.
4. Set the `volume` property to 1.
5. Check the `playing` property (true).

After exporting your project, the audio clip should be playing one time.

Please refer to the `BackgroundMusic`, `Breeze`, `TreeWind`, `Walk` entities in the [`AudioForest`](#audioforest) project for examples.

Alternatively, you can play an AudioClip in a tiny system using an entity's AudioSource. Please refer to the `AudioInputSystem` in the [`AudioForest`](#example-audioforest) project for an example.

### Example: AudioForest

The `AudioForest` project found in `Assets/UTinySamples` covers the use of the Audio Module components. In the project, you will find an example about creating a simple AudioSource, playing an AudioClip, stopping an AudioClip, and pausing/resuming all AudioSources. Use keyboard inputs to add AudioSources and to control the AudioSources.

> This table can be used to associate an Audio Component to a sample entity and/or system.

| UILayout Components | Entity Name | System Name |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [AudioConfig](#audioconfig) |  | AudioInputSystem |
| [AudioClip](#audioclip) |  | AudioInputSystem |
| [AudioSource](#audiosource) | BackgroundMusic, Breeze, TreeWind, Walk | AudioInputSystem |

## Components

Tiny is built around small, lightweight components. This way you only pay for what you need. This design usually creates more component types to represent data held in a single Unity component, which can be confusing at first for some developers.

> This table can be used by Unity developers to associate familiar Unity concepts with Tiny.

| Unity Component   | Audio Components            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| AudioSource       | [AudioConfig](#audioconfig) |
| AudioClip         | [AudioClip](#audioclip)     |
|Â AudioSource       | [AudioSource](#audiosource) |

### AudioConfig

* Unity Reference: [AudioSource](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html)

Specifies the current properties or desired properties to be set for the audio context.

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|paused|Determines if the audio context is paused. If **true**, the audio context is paused.|

### AudioClip

* Unity Reference: [AudioClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioClip.html)

Defines a container for audio data. AudioClips are referenced and used by AudioSources to play sounds.

> [AudioClipStatus](#audioclipstatus) describes the current load state of the audio data associated with the AudioClip.

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|file|Represents an audio file or URL to load.|

### AudioSource

* Unity Reference: [AudioSource](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioSource.html)

Plays back an audio clip in an EntityGroup. Controls the volume and audio clip properties (e.g. `loop`).

> An AudioSource can play a single audio clip. Multiple AudioSources can exist in separated entities.

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|clip|A UTiny entity representing a reference to an audio clip (sound asset) to be played.|
|volume|Represents the audio clip playback volume **between [0..1]**.|
|loop|Determines if the audio clip should replay when it reaches the end. If **true**, the audio clip replays when it ends.|
|playing|Determines if the audio clip is currently playing. If **true**, the audio clip is playing.|

## Systems

### AudioSystem

* Updates After: Shared.RenderingFence

Handles [AudioConfig](#audioconfig), [AudioClip](#audioclip) and [AudioSource](#audiosource) states. More specifically, it initializes the AudioConfig state as well as pausing all sounds if it's set to. It also takes care of the AudioClip load state (e.g. load an AudioClip if it's unloaded). Finally, it handles AudioSources state (e.g. if the source is not playing, the system will stop the music).

## Enums

### AudioClipStatus

Value describing the current load state of the audio data associated with an [AudioClip](#audioclip).

|Value|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Unloaded|Value returned by AudioClip.status for an [AudioClip](#audioclip) that has no audio data loaded and where loading has not been initiated yet.|
|Loading|Value returned by AudioClip.status for an [AudioClip](#audioclip) that is currently loading audio data.|
|Loaded|Value returned by AudioClip.status for an [AudioClip](#audioclip) that has succeeded loading its audio data.|
|LoadError|Value returned by AudioClip.status for an [AudioClip](#audioclip) that has failed loading its audio data.|
