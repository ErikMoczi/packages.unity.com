# Modules

Tiny Mode provides a number of modules which each cover an area of functionality commonly required for games or apps, such as Physics, Animation, UI and Particles.

You can choose whether to include or omit modules from your project individually, which means your build only contains the pieces it needs to run, allowing it to be as small as possible.

As well as these user manual pages, most modules have detailed information in their respective section of the API documentation.
