# Sample Projects

Tiny Mode comes with some sample projects to help you learn by allowing you to examine how some simple sample projects are set up. You can import them into your project using the **Tiny > Import Samples** menu item. This will decompress a package containing all the samples, and allow you to import the package into your project as shown below.

Click the **Import** button. Once imported, the Tiny Mode sample project files will be available in the Project window. Because there are multiple Tiny Mode sample projects included in the package, you must then open one of the sample projects by double-clicking the Tiny Mode Project file in the sample folder of your choice.

Once you have opened one of the sample projects, you will see the Hierarchy window showing the entity groups for the project, and the start entity group's contents will be visible in the Scene view.

<!-- TO DO : add screenshots of final sample projects -->
