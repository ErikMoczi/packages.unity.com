## _3D Project Template_ ##

Configures Project settings for 3D apps that use Unityâ€™s built-in rendering pipeline.

3D games usually make use of three-dimensional geometry, with Materials and Textures rendered on the surface of GameObjects
 to make them appear as solid environments, characters and objects that make up your game world. The Camera can move in and around the Scene
 freely, with light and shadows cast around the world in a realistic way. 3D games usually render the Scene using perspective, so objects 
 appear larger on screen as they get closer to the camera. For all games that fit this description, start in 3D mode. 
 
 There are several other templates that are for 3D games: Lightweight, High Definition
 and 3D With Extras templates. However these contain changes to settings and include additional features and tools that tailor them to more specific user need.
 
 This project template is completely empty. It does not contain Post Processing, a Scriptable Render Pipeline or Shadergraph. It does not contain presets, or example content. By default the color space is gamma.
