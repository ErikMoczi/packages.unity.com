# Tiny Mode Settings

When in Tiny Mode, a number of settings become available in Unity's main [settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html) window.

These settings give you control over how your project is organized and how it should be built when you create a build.

There are six sections to the Tiny Mode settings in the inspector:

- [The main settings](settings-main.md)
- [Assets](settings-assets.md)
- [Build Report](settings-build-report.md)
- [Components](settings-components.md)
- [Entities](settings-entities.md)
- [Modules](settings-modules.md)
