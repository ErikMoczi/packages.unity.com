# Using Tiny Mode in the Editor

Tiny Mode is a special mode in the Unity Editor. Unity automatically switches to Tiny Mode when you open a Tiny Mode project. Unity switches _out_ of Tiny Mode (back to normal mode) if you open a regular Unity Scene in your project, or open a different Unity Project that does not use Tiny Mode.
