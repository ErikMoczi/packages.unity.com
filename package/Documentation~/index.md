# Tiny Mode

Unity's Tiny Mode provides a set of workflow features and a specialized build pipeline that allows you to create small, lightweight **HTML5** games and apps in the Unity Editor. For example, you can use Tiny Mode to create playable ads or games for messaging platforms.

Tiny Mode achieves this by providing you with a specialized, highly modular architecture, which represents a subset of Unity's full features, along with purpose-built tools that give you fine control over file size. This results in quicker runtimes for lightweight devices, with ultra-fast delivery and startup times.

Much of Unity's normal workflow is available in Tiny Mode, meaning artists and developers can work together, in context, with the tools they already know.
