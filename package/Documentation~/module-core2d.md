# Core2D Module

The Core2D module provides support for a subset of Unity's 2D features in Tiny Mode. This page provides common use cases, examples, and a reference of the Core2D components.

### Simple Sprite Rendering

Core2D provides a **Sprite2DRenderer** component which you can use to draw sprites on the screen.

You can quickly create an entity with a Sprite2DRenderer component attached, and a sprite assigned, by dragging a Sprite asset from the Project window to the Tiny Hierarchy window. This creates an entity with a properly setup [Sprite2DRenderer](#sprite2drenderer) component.

Alternatively you can perform these steps manually:
1. Create an Entity
2. Add the [Transform](#transform) component
3. Add the [Sprite2DRenderer](#sprite2drenderer) component
4. Set the **sprite** property to a Sprite asset

Sprites are rendered in local space at the pixels-per-unit scale defined in the [Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html) asset. You can change the scale by selecting the Texture in the Project window and modifying its **Pixels Per Unit** property in the Inspector window.

You can add the [Sprite2DRendererOptions](#sprite2drendereroptions) component for more control over Sprite rendering.

### 9-slicing Sprites

1. Follow the steps in the [9-slicing Sprites](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/9SliceSprites.html)  topic in the Unity User Manual to prepare a Sprite asset.
2. Set the **Mesh Type** of the Sprite to **Full Rect**.
3. Set the appropriate Sprite borders in the Sprite Editor window.
4. Once your Sprite asset is properly configured, add both the [Sprite2DRenderer](#sprite2drenderer) and the [Sprite2DRendererOptions](#sprite2drendereroptions) components to the entity.
5. Follow the steps in [Simple Sprite Rendering](#simple-sprite-rendering).

Depending on your desired visual outcome, you can configure the [Sprite2DRendererOptions](#sprite2drendereroptions) drawMode property to either ContinuousTiling or AdaptiveTiling. Set the drawMode property to **Stretch**, the default value, to remove the 9-slicing rendering effect. See [DrawMode](#drawmode) for more details about these modes.

### Sorting Sprites

By default, Tiny Mode orders sprites according to the Z axis. You can use the following components to change this behavior:

- Use the [LayerSorting](#layersorting) component to place sprites on the specified Unity sorting layer or in the specified order. The LayerSorting component is ofter used to sort background sprites with foreground sprites. This component enables you to have as many sorting layers as you want.
- Use the [SortingGroup](#sortinggroup) component to group sprites together within a hierarchy. This component prevents multi-sprite objects from conflicting their ordering with other multi-sprite objects.
- Use the [Camera2DAxisSort](#camera2daxissort) component to modify the default `(0, 0, 1)` sort axis of cameras. This component orders sprites along the Y axis to create a fake perspective effect where lower Y sprites appear on top of higher Y sprites.

Tiny Mode uses the same priority as Unity for these different sorting components:

1. Sort by [LayerSorting](#layersorting) layer. If it's a tie, then:
2. Sort by [LayerSorting](#layersorting) order. If it's a tie, then:
3. Sort by [Camera2DAxisSort](#camera2daxissort) or default Z axis. If it's a tie, then:
4. Sorting is undefined.

Note that [SortingGroup](#sortinggroup) always precedes other sorting components to ensure sprites are always grouped together. However, sprites can be freely re-ordered within a [SortingGroup](#sortinggroup) and follows the same behavior and priority as described above.

### Using Sprite Atlas

A [Sprite Atlas](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteAtlas.html) is a texture asset containing multiple sprite images. It is used to export optimized textures in runtime saving memory space and allowing easy theme customization for your Tiny project.

1. Create a [Sprite Atlas](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteAtlas.html).
2. Add an object (e.g. sprite) for packing.
3. Follow the steps in [Simple Sprite Rendering](#simple-sprite-rendering). Select a sprite from the Sprite Atlas.

Alternatively, you can add a folder to the **Objects for Packing** if you have multiple sprites to add to your Sprite Atlas. You can preview the Sprite Atlas using the **Pack Preview** button.

_Note: Some settings such as **Allow Rotation** and **Tight Packing** are not supported in Tiny Mode yet._

The Sprite Atlas should be exported with the project. An exported Sprite Atlas will generate an entity with a [SpriteAtlas](#spriteatlas) component, as well as a texture. Sprites part of a Sprite Atlas will be exported with path `assets/sprites/<Sprite Atlas name>/<Sprite name>`. It is possible to get those Sprites by searching through the World's entities: `world.getByName(<Sprite path>)`. Please refer to the `SkinSystem` in the [`Flappy`](#example-flappy) project for an example.

> A Sprite Atlas will not be exported with the project if none of its sprites is  referenced by a Tiny entity (e.g. in a [Sprite2DRenderer](#sprite2drenderer) component). In this case, you can add an explicit reference to one of its sprites in the [Assets tab](../tiny-editor.md#assets-tab). By doing so, the Sprite Atlas should be exported properly and its sprites should be accessible in runtime.

### Example: Flying Yolk Project

The **Flying Yolk** project found in `Assets/UTinySamples` covers the use of the Core2D Module components and of Sprite Atlas. In the project, you will find an example about creating a game scene with a camera, positioning entities, rendering sprites, animating sprites, and using multiple themes with Sprite Atlas.

> This table can be used to associate a Core2D Component to an entity and/or a system.

| Core2D Components | Entity Name | System Name |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Camera2D](#camera2d) | Camera |  |
| LayerSorting | Backgrounds, Grounds, Bird |  |
| [SortingGroup](#sortinggroup) | Grounds |  |
| [SpriteAtlas](#spriteatlas) |  | SkinSystem |
| [Sprite2DRenderer](#sprite2drenderer) | Backgrounds, ground0, ground1, ground2, ground3, Bird, GetReady, Tutorial, Title, GameOver, Scoreboard, Character_2, Character_1, Character_0, Pipe_Top, Pipe_Bottom |  |
| [Sprite2DRendererOptions](#sprite2drendereroptions) | Backgrounds | SkinSystem |
| [Sprite2DSequence](#sprite2dsequence) | Bird | SkinSystem |
| [Sprite2DSequencePlayer](#sprite2dsequenceplayer) | Bird |  |
| [Transform](#transform) | WorldScale, Backgrounds, Grounds, ground0, ground1, ground2, ground3, Bird, Bounds, Camera, GetReady, Tutorial, Title, GameOver, Scoreboard, FinalScore, Character_2, Character_1, Character_0, HighScore, Pipes, Pipe_Top, Pipe_Bottom, Score | AutoDestroySystem, RepeatedBackgroundSystem, ScrollingObjectSystem |

This project contains three Sprite Atlases (`Game`, `Day`, `Night`). `Game` contains common assets whereas `Day` and `Night` contain skin sprites (background, bird, pipe). To switch between the `Day` and `Night` skin, we rename sprites for the same entity with the same name (e.g. `bg` sprite in the [Assets tab](../tiny-editor.md#assets-tab)).

## Components

Tiny is built around small, lightweight components. This way you only pay for what you need. This design usually creates more component types to represent data held in a single Unity component, which can be confusing at first for some developers.

Use this table to associate familiar Unity concepts with Tiny Mode.

### SequencePlayerSystem

* Updates Before: Shared.InputFence

A system used to drive [Sprite2DSequencePlayer](#sprite2dsequenceplayer) components.

## Enums

|Value|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Alpha|Traditional transparency. Translates to `output = (source alpha * source fragment) + ((1 – source alpha) * destination fragment)`.|
|Add|Additive blending. Translates to `output = source fragment + destination fragment`.|
|Multiply|Multiplicative blending. Translates to `output = source fragment * destination fragment`.|
