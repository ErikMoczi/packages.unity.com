# Getting started

To start building a project in Tiny Mode, you must install the Tiny Mode package in your project 

See [Installing the package](installing-tiny.md) further down in this document.

Once installed, you have access to the Tiny Mode workflow features, as well as a number of [sample projects](sample-projects.md). The sample projects can be a useful reference for you to try out, and you can inspect the assets and source code used within.
