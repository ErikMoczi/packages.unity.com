# Particles Module

Tiny supports a subset of the particle workflows available in Unity. This subset is referred to as the Particles module. This document provides common use cases, examples, and a reference of Particles components.

## Use Cases and Examples

This section demonstrates how to use the Particles module through common use cases and usage examples. If a use case or an example is similar to a topic in the Unity User Manual, a link is provided to the appropriate topic.

### Simple Particle System

1. Create a [Sprite2D entity](./manual-module-core2d.md#simple-sprite-rendering). This will be your proto-particle.
2. Create an entity.
    1. Add a [ParticleEmitter](#particleemitter) component.
    2. Set the `particle` property to the Sprite2D entity.
    3. Add a [EmitterBoxSource](#emitterboxsource) component.

Modify the [ParticleEmitter](#particleemitter) or the [EmitterBoxSource](#emitterboxsource) properties to affect the emission (e.g. emission rate).

### Spawn particles with initial modifiers

After adding a particle system, it is easy to control the state of newly created particles. From the [ParticleEmitter](#particleemitter) component, you can add a related component using the `+` button.

1. Add a [EmitterInitialScale](#emitterinitialscale) component to set the scale of each particle on emission.
2. Add a [EmitterInitialRotation](#emitterinitialrotation) component to set the rotation around the z-axis of each particle on emission.
3. Add a [EmitterInitialVelocity](#emitterinitialvelocity) component to set the velocity (direction and speed) of each particle on emission.

For each of these components, it is possible to define the upper and lower bounds for the value; the actual value varies randomly between those bounds.

### Spawn particles with changes over time

After adding a particle system, it is easy to specify the particle's changes over time. From the [ParticleEmitter](#particleemitter) component, you can add a related component using the `+` button. Using a change over time component will most likely override any initial value component you provided.

#### Using a gradient
1. Create an empty entity.
    1. Add a Gradient component.
    2. Set the color/alpha values on the gradient so that it represents the lifetime of the particle.
2. Add a [LifetimeColor](#lifetimecolor) component to the particle system entity in order to change the particle's color over time.

#### Using a curve
1. Create an empty entity.
    1. Add a Curve component.
    2. Set the response values (y-axis) on the graph so that it represents the lifetime of the particle.

A Curve entity will be used to specify the value over the particle's lifetime for one of these components:
1. Add a [LifetimeAlpha](#lifetimealpha) component to the particle system entity in order to change the particle's transparency over time. `Note:` This component is ignored when the entity also has a [LifetimeColor](#lifetimecolor) component with a defined gradient.
2. Add a [LifetimeRotation](#lifetimerotation) component to the particle system entity in order to change the particle's rotation over time.
3. Add a [LifetimeScale](#lifetimescale) component to the particle system entity in order to change the particle's scale over time.
4. Add a [LifetimeVelocity](#lifetimevelocity) component to the particle system entity in order to change the particle's velocity (direction and speed) over time.

Alternatively, you can check the `Modulate` property to specify if the particle's value is multiplied with its start value.

### Example: Fireworks

The `Fireworks` project found in `Assets/UTinySamples` covers the use of the Particles Module components.

## Components

Tiny is built around small, lightweight components. This way you only pay for what you need. This design usually creates more component types to represent data held in a single Unity component, which can be confusing at first for some developers.

It is linked to the source data, the initial values and the lifetime values for particles. It contains global properties that affect the whole system (e.g. `lifetime` property). Various particle modifiers after initial emit can be added as component (e.g. [EmitterInitialScale](#emitterinitialscale)).

|maxParticles|The maximum number of particles in the system at once. If the limit is reached, some particles are removed. Defaults to 1000.|
|emitRate|The number of particles emitted per **second**. Defaults to 10.|
|startDelay|Delay in **seconds** before the system starts emitting once enabled.|
|prewarmPercent|The number of particles to immediately generate at start. It's the multiplier of maxPaticles (0.0: none, 1.0: maxParticles).|
|lifetime|The lifetime of each particle in **seconds**. Defaults start (min) and end (max) to 5.|
