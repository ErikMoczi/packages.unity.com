## Connecting a Player

>NOTE: The input debugger connection to the player is still being worked on. At the moment, it is still unstable and unreliable.

>NOTE: At the moment, debugging input in players is restricted to seeing devices and events from connected players. There is no support yet for seeing other input-related data from players.
