## [0.7.1-preview] - 2018-08-01

### Fixed

## [0.7.0-preview] - 2018-07-26

### Known Issues
> Warning: This release changes how your projects are saved to disk. Make sure to backup your projects before upgrading to this release, and let us know if you experience any issue opening or saving your projects.

> Attention: You must reimport all assets after this update. Right-click the project window and click "Reimport All"
* Auto-complete incorrectly converts the first character of field names to lowercase. A fix is due in the next release.
* Profiler connection with Unity is not working. A fix is due in the next release.
* TypeScript pipeline is not optimized. This affects project load time and script imports. A fix is due in the next release.

### Added
* **TypeScript is now supported** as the default scripting language. Definition files (`.d.ts`) files are available for the Tiny runtime API, and are maintained semi-automatically for user-created Tiny types (components, structs, enums, and systems).
* Development environments that support TypeScript will give you **auto-complete**. We tested this workflow using Visual Studio 2017, Rider, VS Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. Visual Studio 2015 is not supported. Make sure to get the latest popular compatible Typescript plugin for Atom/VSCode/Sublime.
* A new **UI Layout** module was added. This is the first release with in-Editor support for GUI, expect more GUI support in future releases. Refer to the module documentation page for common use cases and more details.
* Added documentation for the new UI Layout module
* A conversion dialogue window has been added for older projects.

### Changed
* A new project structure is created when you create a new Tiny project.
* Entity groups are now serialized in separate `.utdata` files (they were serialized in the monolithic `.utproject` file before). This is to facilitate collaboration on larger projects: expect new file types for Tiny objects in future releases.
* Systems now always assume the definition of an `update` function on the generated system object (e.g. one script in your project includes `game.MySystem.update = function(scheduler, world) { /* game logic goes here */ });`. This behaviour was previously supported by the *External* option in the Editor UI, and is now the only way to schedule a system. Existing projects are automatically migrated to this requirement.
* UI: Static Entities have been removed. Entities with no transforms appear as normal entities. Re-parenting an entity with no Transform component will automatically add a Transform component.

### Fixed
* Fixed undo stability problems


## [0.6.0-preview] - 2018-07-12
