## [0.4.2-preview] - 2018-10-09
 - MINIMUM RECOMMENDED VERSION - 2018.2.11+ 
   - We have re-enabled the addressables checkbox. Versions of 2018.2 older than the .11 release will work unless you attempt to view the Animation Import Settings inspector.  If you do have animations you need to inspect, use .11+. If you do not, use any official release version of 2018.2.
 - refactored the way IResourceProviders are initialized in the player - serialized data is constructed at runtime to control how the providers are configured
 - added readonly custom inspector for AddressableAssetEntryCollection
 - AssetReference now stores the loaded asset which can be accessed via the Asset property after LoadAsset completes.  ReleaseAsset has been modified to not need the asset passed in (the old version is marked obsolete]
 - fixed profiler details view not updating when a mouse drag is completed
 - fixed null-ref when moving Resources to Addressables when there are no Resources
 - blocked moving EditorSceneList within GUI
 - fixed cap on address name length
 - fixed workflows of marking Resources as addressable and moving an addressable into Resources.
 - fixed issue where AssetReferenceDrawer did not mark scene as dirty when changed.
 - added Hosting Services feature; provides extensible framework and implementation for serving packed content to player builds from the Editor
 - replaced addressables buildscript with an interface based system.  IDataBuilder class is now used to define builders of specific types of data.  The Addressables settings object
   contains a collection of data builders and uses these to create player and play mode data.  Users can implemented custom data builders to control the build process.
 - replaced AssetGroupProcessors with a collection of AssetGroupSchema objects.  The difference is that the schema objects only contain data and groups can have multiple schemas.  The 
   logic for processing groups now resides in the build script and uses the schemas as data sources and filters for how to build.
 - Added Initialization objects that can be created during the build to run during addressables initialization
 - Implemented Caching API initialization with initialization objects
 - Changed some API and tests to work with 2019.x
 - fixed how AssetReference's draw when within lists, arrays, or contained classes
 - Fixed the workflow of scenes moving in and out of the Editor Build Settings Scene list. 
 - Removed "Preview" and added "Analyze". 
   - The new system runs any rules it knows about. 
   - Currently this is one rule that is manually set up in code. Future work will have additional rules, and expose the ability to create/add user- or project-specific rules
   - This process can be slow, as it runs most of a build to get accurate data.
   - Within the Analyze window there is a "fix" button that allows each rule to fix any issues if the rule knows how. 
   - The current rule is a "check duplicate asset" rule. This looks for assets that are pulled into multiple asset bundles due to dependency calculations. The way it fixes things is to move all of those into a newly created group.
 - Added option to toggle logging of all exceptions within the Resource Manager
 - Refactored initialization of the addressable asset settings to prevent it getting into a bad state.

## [0.3.5-preview] - 2018-09-05
 - implemented content update workflow.  Added a dropdown to the "Build" button on main window's toolbar.   
    - "Build/Prepare for Content Update" will detect assets in locked bundles (bundles flagged as static, by default all local bundles).
    - "Build/Build for Content Update" will build assets with a catalog that is compatible with a previously released player.
	- "Build/Build Packed Data" will build in the same way entering play mode in PackedMode would.
	- implemented Clean Build. "Build/Clean/*" will clear out build caches. 
 - cleaned up streaming assets folder better after build
 - moved asset group data into separate assets in order to better support version control
 - fixed bug when canceling export of entries to an AssetEntryCollection
 - fixed several bugs related to caching packed bundles in play mode
 - added option to build settings to control whether streaming assets is cleared after each build
 - enabled CreateBuiltInShadersBundle task in build and preview
 - fixed bug in AA initialization that was cuasing tests to fail when AA is not being used.
 - fixed bug where toggling "send profiler events" would have no effect in some situations
 - default the first 2 converted groups to have StaticContent set to true
 - UI Redesign
  - Moved most data settings onto actual assets.  AddressableAssetSettings and AddressableAssetGroup assets.
    - AddressableAssetSettings asset has "Send Profile Events", list of groups, labels, and profiles
	- AddressableAssetGroup assets have all data associated with that group (such as BuildPath)
  - Made "preview" be a sub-section within the Addressables window.
  - The "Default" group can now be set with a right-click in the Addressables window.
  - Set play mode from "Mode" dropdown on main window's toolbar. 
  - Moved "Hierarchical Search" option onto magnifying glass of search bar.  Removed now empty settings cog button.
 - fixed issue when packing groups into seperate bundles generated duplicate asset bundle names, leading to an error being thrown during build
 - added support for disabling the automatic initialization of the addressables system at runtime via a script define:  ADDRESSABLES_DISABLE_AUTO_INITIALIZATION
 - added API to create AssetReference from AddressableAssetSettings object in order to create an entry if it does not exist.
 - moving resource profiler from the ResourceManager package to the Addressables package
 - fixed bug where UnloadScene operation never entered Done state or called callback.
 - fixed loading of additonal catalogs. The API has changed to Addressables.LoadCatalogsFromRuntimeData.
 - fixed bug in InitializationOperation where content catalogs were not found.
 - changed content update workflow to browse for cachedata.bin file instead of folder
 - fixed exception thrown when creating a group and using .NET 4.x
 - fixed bugs surrounding a project without addressables data.
  - AssetLabelReference inspector rendering
  - AssetReference drag and drop
 - fixed profiler details view not updating when a mouse drag is completed
 - fixes surrounding the stability of interacting with the "default" group.
 - Added docs for the Content Update flow.
 - Adjusted UI slightly so single-clicking groups shows their inspector.
 - removed not-helpful "Build/Build Packed Data" item from menu.  
 - fixed bug where you could no longer create groups, and group assets were not named correctly
