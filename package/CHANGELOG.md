## [0.1.2-preview] - 2018-12-19

    NOTE: The minimum version requirement for the new input system has been bumped
          to 2018.3. The previous minum requirement of 2018.2 is no longer supported.
          Also, we have dropped support for the .NET 3.5 runtime. The new .NET 4
          runtime is now required to use the new input system.

We've started working on documentation. The current work-in-progress can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem/blob/develop/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem/Documentation~/InputSystem.md).

### Changed

- `InputConfiguration` has been replaced with a new `InputSettings` class.
- `InputConfiguration.lockInputToGame` has been moved to `InputEditorUserSettings.lockInputToGameView`. This setting is now persisted as a local user setting.
- `InputSystem.updateMask` has been replaced with `InputSettings.updateMode`.
- `InputSystem.runInBackground` has been moved to `InputSettings.runInBackground`.
- Icons have been updated for improved styling and now have separate dark and light skin versions.
- `Lock Input To Game` and `Diagnostics Mode` are now persisted as user settings
- Brought back `.current` getters and added `InputSettings.filterNoiseOnCurrent` to control whether noise filtering on the getters is performed or not.
- Removed old and outdated Doxygen-generated API docs.

### Added

- `InputSystem.settings` contains the current input system settings.
- A new UI has been added to "Edit >> Project Settings..." to edit input system settings. Settings are stored in a user-controlled asset in any location inside `Assets/`. Multiple assets can be used and switched between.
- Joystick HIDs are now supported on Windows, Mac, and UWP.
- Can now put system into manual update mode (`InputSettings.updateMode`). In this mode, events will not get automatically processed. To process events, call `InputSystem.Update()`.
- Added shortcuts to action editor window (requires 2019.1).
- Added icons for .inputactions assets.

### Fixed

- `InputSystem.devices` not yet being initialized in `MonoBehaviour.Start` when in editor.

### Known Issues

- Input settings are not yet included in player builds. This means that at the moment, player builds will always start out with default input settings.
- There have been reports of some stickiness to buttons on 2019.1 alpha builds.  We are looking at this now.

## [0.0.14-preview] - 2018-12-11

### Changed

- `Pointer.delta` no longer has `SensitivityProcessor` on it. The processor was causing many issues with mouse deltas. It is still available for adding it manually to action bindings but the processor likely needs additional work.

### Fixed

Core:
- Invalid memory accesses when using .NET 4 runtime
- Mouse.button not being identical to Mouse.leftButton
- DualShock not being recognized when connected via Bluetooth

Actions:
- Parameters disappearing on processors and interactions in UI when edited
- Parameters on processors and interactions having wrong value type in UI (e.g. int instead of float)
- RebindingOperation calling OnComplete() after being cancelled

Misc:
- Documentation no longer picked up as assets in user project

## [0.0.13-preview] - 2018-12-5

First release from stable branch.
