## [1.0.2-preview.2] - 2019-02-15
 - *BREAKING CODE CHANGES* 
   - to ease code navigation, we have added several layers of namespace to the code.  
   - any hardcoded profile path to com.unity.addressables (specifically LocalLoadPath, RemoteLoadPath, etc) should use UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.RuntimePath instead.  
       For build paths, replace Assets/StreamingAssets/com.unity.addressables/[BuildTarget] with [UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.BuildPath]/[BuildTarget]
	   For load paths,  replace Assets/StreamingAssets/com.unity.addressables/[BuildTarget] with {UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.RuntimePath}/[BuildTarget]
   - We have removed attribute AssetReferenceTypeRestriction as it is cleaner to enforce type via generics
   - Attribute AssetReferenceLabelRestriction is renamed to AssetReferenceUILabelRestriction and must be surrounded by #if UNITY_EDITOR in your game code, to enforce it's editor-only capability
   - Modifications to IResourceProvider API.
   - Removed PreloadDependencies API.  Instead use DownloadDependencies
 - Content Update calculation has changed, this will invalide previously generated addressables_content_state.bin files.
   - Some types for content update were made private as a result of the above change.
 - Moved all of the Resource Manager package to be contained within Addressables (no longer a stand alone package).  No code change implications. 
 - Change to content catalog building: 
   - Previous model built one catalog per group, wherever that group built it's data.
   - New model builds one catalog locally, and optionally one "remote".  Remote location is set on the top level AddressableAssetSettings object.
   - Loading will now always check if remote has changes (if remote exists), and use local otherwise (or cached version of remote).
 - LoadScene API now takes LoadSceneParameters in 2018.2+
 - Exposed AddressablesBuildDataBuilderContext.BuildScriptContextConstants for use in build scripts.
 - Refactored AddressablesBuildDataBuilderContext.GetValue to take default parameter.
 - Fixed Scene asset path to be consistent between different play modes in the catalog data.
 - Exposed the various IDataBuilder implementations as public classes.
 - Exposed asset and bundle provider types for BundledAssetGroupSchema.
 - Fixed several bugs when loading catalogs from other projects.
 - Added provider suffix to Initialization operation and Adddressables.LoadCatalogsFromRuntimeData API to better support overriding providers.
 - Exposed CachedProvider options in BundledAssetGroupSchema.  Each unique set of parameters will generate a separate provider.  There is also an option to force a group to have its own providers.
 - Added IEnumerable<object> Keys property to IResourceLocator interface.
 - Exposed InitializationOperation as public API.
 - Added BuildTarget to ResourceManagerRuntimeData.  This is used to check if the generated player content was built with the same build target as the player or the editor when entering play mode.
 - Removed warnings generated from not finding the cached catalog hash files, which is not an error.
 - Fixed bug where scenes were not unloading.
 - Fixed GUI exception thrown in group inspector.
 - Fixed error case where an asset (usually a bundle) was loaded multiple times as different types (object and AssetBundle).
 - Fixed divide by zero bug when computing load percent of simulated asset bundles.
 - AddressableAssetBuildResult.CreateResult now takes the settingsPath as a parameter to pass this to the result.
 - Fix AssetReference GUI when the AssetReference is inside an array of classes
 - Fix AssetReferenceSprite to properly support sprites (as opposed to Texture2D's).
 - Fixed bug involving scenes being repeatedly added to the build scenes list.
 - Removed deprecated and obsolete code.  If you are upgrading from a very old version of Addressables, please update to 0.5.3-preview first.
 - Removed the default MergeMode on LoadAssets calls to enforce explicit behavior. 
 - Added IAsyncOperation<long> GetDownloadSize(object key) API to compute remaining data needed to load an asset
 - Fixed assets being stuck in a read-only state in UI
 - Unified asset moving API to clean up public interface
 - Added PlayerVersion override to AddressableAssetSettings
 - Ensure UI cannot show invalide assets (such as .cs files)
 - Renamed Adddressables.LoadAddtionalCatalogs to Addressables.LoadContentCatalog and now it takes the path of the catalog instead of the settings file
 - Moved provider information from ResourceManagerRuntimeDate into ContentCatalogData
 - Updating ResourceManager to be a non-static class
 - Fixed bugs surrounding assets moving in or out of Resources (outside Addressables UI) 
 - Fixed the AssetReference dropdown to properly filter valid assets (no Resources and honoring type or label limitations). 
 - Fixed AssetReferences to handle assets inside folders marked as Addressable.
 - Added attribute AssetReferenceUIRestriction to support user-created AssetReference restrictions (they are only enforced in UI, for dropdown and drag&drop)
 - All Instantiate API calls (Adddressables and AssetReference) have been changed to only work with GameObjects.
 - Changed addressables_content_state.bin to only build to the folder containing the AddressableAssetSettings object (Assets/AddressableAssetsData/ in most cases)
 
## [0.5.3-preview] - 2018-12-19
 - fixed upgrade bug from 0.4.x or lower to 0.5.x or higher. During upgrade, the "Packed Mode" option was removed from play mode.  Now it's back and upgrades are safe from 0.4.x or from 0.5.x to 0.5.3
 
## [0.5.2-preview] - 2018-12-14
 - *IMPORTANT CHANGE TO BUILDING* 
   - We have disabled automatic asset bundle building.  That used to happen when you built the player, or entered play mode in "packed mode".  This is no longer the case.  You must now select "Build->Build Player Content" from the Addressables window, or call AddressableAssetSettings.BuildPlayerContent().  We did this because we determined that automatic building did not scale well at all for large projects.  
 - fixed regression loading local bundles
 - Added Adddressables.DownloadDependencies() interface
 - fixes for Nintendo Switch support
 - Fixed issues around referencing Addressables during an Awake() call
 - Code refactor and naming convention fixes
 - Cleaned up missing docs
 - Content update now handles not having and groups marked as Static Content
 - Fixed errors when browing for the addressables_content_state.bin and cancelling 
 - Moved addressables_content_state.bin to be generated into the addressables settings folder
 - Changed some exceptions when releasing null bundles to warnings to handle the case of releasing a failed download operation
 - Separated hash and crc options to allow them to be used independently in asset bundle loads.
 - Use CRC in AssetBundle.LoadFromFileAsync calls if specified
 - Always include AssetBundleRequestOptions for asset bundle locations
 
## [0.4.8-preview] - 2018-10-22
 - Added all referenced types in asset bundles to link.xml to prevent them from being stripped in IL2CPP builds

## [0.4.7-preview] - 2018-10-20
 - updated Scriptable Build Pipeline version in dependencies

## [0.4.6-preview] - 2018-10-16
 - MINIMUM RECOMMENDED VERSION - 2018.2.11+ 
   - We have re-enabled the addressables checkbox. Versions of 2018.2 older than the .11 release will work unless you attempt to view the Animation Import Settings inspector.  If you do have animations you need to inspect, use .11+. If you do not, use any official release version of 2018.2.
 - refactored the way IResourceProviders are initialized in the player - serialized data is constructed at runtime to control how the providers are configured
 - added readonly custom inspector for AddressableAssetEntryCollection
 - AssetReference now stores the loaded asset which can be accessed via the Asset property after LoadAsset completes.  ReleaseAsset has been modified to not need the asset passed in (the old version is marked obsolete]
 - fixed profiler details view not updating when a mouse drag is completed
 - fixed null-ref when moving Resources to Addressables when there are no Resources
 - blocked moving EditorSceneList within GUI
 - fixed cap on address name length
 - fixed workflows of marking Resources as addressable and moving an addressable into Resources.
 - fixed issue where AssetReferenceDrawer did not mark scene as dirty when changed.
 - added Hosting Services feature; provides extensible framework and implementation for serving packed content to player builds from the Editor
 - replaced addressables buildscript with an interface based system.  IDataBuilder class is now used to define builders of specific types of data.  The Addressables settings object
   contains a collection of data builders and uses these to create player and play mode data.  Users can implemented custom data builders to control the build process.
 - replaced AssetGroupProcessors with a collection of AssetGroupSchema objects.  The difference is that the schema objects only contain data and groups can have multiple schemas.  The 
   logic for processing groups now resides in the build script and uses the schemas as data sources and filters for how to build.
 - Added Initialization objects that can be created during the build to run during addressables initialization
 - Implemented Caching API initialization with initialization objects
 - Changed some API and tests to work with 2019.x
 - fixed how AssetReference's draw when within lists, arrays, or contained classes
 - Fixed the workflow of scenes moving in and out of the Editor Build Settings Scene list. 
 - Removed "Preview" and added "Analyze". 
   - The new system runs any rules it knows about. 
   - Currently this is one rule that is manually set up in code. Future work will have additional rules, and expose the ability to create/add user- or project-specific rules
   - This process can be slow, as it runs most of a build to get accurate data.
   - Within the Analyze window there is a "fix" button that allows each rule to fix any issues if the rule knows how. 
   - The current rule is a "check duplicate asset" rule. This looks for assets that are pulled into multiple asset bundles due to dependency calculations. The way it fixes things is to move all of those into a newly created group.
 - Added option to toggle logging of all exceptions within the Resource Manager
 - Refactored initialization of the addressable asset settings to prevent it getting into a bad state.

## [0.3.5-preview] - 2018-09-05
 - implemented content update workflow.  Added a dropdown to the "Build" button on main window's toolbar.   
    - "Build/Prepare for Content Update" will detect assets in locked bundles (bundles flagged as static, by default all local bundles).
    - "Build/Build for Content Update" will build assets with a catalog that is compatible with a previously released player.
	- "Build/Build Packed Data" will build in the same way entering play mode in PackedMode would.
	- implemented Clean Build. "Build/Clean/*" will clear out build caches.

 - default the first 2 converted groups to have StaticContent set to true
 - UI Redesign
  - Moved most data settings onto actual assets.  AddressableAssetSettings and AddressableAssetGroup assets.
    - AddressableAssetSettings asset has "Send Profile Events", list of groups, labels, and profiles
	- AddressableAssetGroup assets have all data associated with that group (such as BuildPath)
  - Made "preview" be a sub-section within the Addressables window.
  - The "Default" group can now be set with a right-click in the Addressables window.
  - Set play mode from "Mode" dropdown on main window's toolbar. 
  - Moved "Hierarchical Search" option onto magnifying glass of search bar.  Removed now empty settings cog button.
 - fixed issue when packing groups into seperate bundles generated duplicate asset bundle names, leading to an error being thrown during build
 - added support for disabling the automatic initialization of the addressables system at runtime via a script define:  ADDRESSABLES_DISABLE_AUTO_INITIALIZATION
 - added API to create AssetReference from AddressableAssetSettings object in order to create an entry if it does not exist.
 - moving resource profiler from the ResourceManager package to the Addressables package
 - fixed bug where UnloadScene operation never entered Done state or called callback.
 - fixed loading of additonal catalogs. The API has changed to Addressables.LoadCatalogsFromRuntimeData.
 - fixed bug in InitializationOperation where content catalogs were not found.
 - changed content update workflow to browse for cachedata.bin file instead of folder
