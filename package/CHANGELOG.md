# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0-preview.20] - 2018-12-13

- Fix package dependency.

## [1.0.0-preview.19] - 2018-12-13
- Add C header file necessary to interpret native pointers. See `Includes~/UnityXRNativePtrs.h`
- Add support for setting the camera focus mode.
- Add a build check to ensure only ARM64 is selected as the only target architecture.
- Implement `CameraConfiguration` support, allowing you to enumerate and set the resolution used by the hardware camera.

## [1.0.0-preview.18] - 2018-11-21
### New
- Added ARKit Face Tracking support via `com.unity.xr.facesubsystem`.
- Plane detection modes: Add ability to selectively enable detection for horizontal, vertical, or both types of planes.

## [1.0.0-preview.17] - 2018-10-06
### Fixes
- Fixed an issue where toggling plane detection or light estimation would momentarily pause the ARSession, causing tracking to become temporarily unstable.
- Fixed the (new) CameraImage API to work with the 2018.3 betas.
- ARKit's `ARTrackingStateLimited` was reported as `TrackingState.Tracking`. It is now reported as `TrackingState.Unavailable`.

### Improvements
- Add support for native pointer access for several ARSession-related native objects.
- Add [ARWorldMap](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldmap) support.
- Add linker validation when building with the IL2CPP scripting backend to avoid stripping the Unity.XR.ARKit assembly.

## [1.0.0-preview.16] - 2018-10-10
### New
- Added support for `XRCameraExtensions` API to get the raw camera image data on the CPU. See the [ARFoundation manual documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@1.0/manual/cpu-camera-image.html) for more information.

## [1.0.0-preview.15] - 2018-09-18
### Fixes
- Fix memory leak when destroying the ARSession.

## [1.0.0-preview.14] - 2018-08-10
- Add a pre build check to make sure Metal is the first selected Graphics API in Player Settings.
- Remove restriction on symlinking Unity libraries in Build Settings if using Unity 2018.3 or newer.
- Change plugin entry point in UnityARKit.a to avoid name collisions with other libraries (was `UnityPluginLoad`).

## [1.0.0-preview.13] - 2018-07-17
- Update plugin to be compatible with Unity 2018.3
- `ARPlane.trackingState` reports the session `TrackingState` for ARKit planes (previously it returned `TrackingState.Unknown`). ARKit planes do not have per-plane tracking states, so if they exist and the session is tracking, then the SDK will now report that the planes are tracked.

## [1.0.0-preview.12] - 2018-06-20
- Add -fembed-bitcode flag to UnityARKit.a to support archiving.
- Fail the build if "Symlink Unity libraries" is checked.

## [1.0.0-preview.11] - 2018-06-14
- Fail the build if Camera Usage Description is blank

## [1.0.0-preview.10] - 2018-06-08
- Do not include build postprocessor when not on iOS
- Add support for reference points attached to planes

## [1.0.0-preview.9] - 2018-06-06
- Remove extraneous debug log

## [1.0.0-preview.8] - 2018-05-07

### Added 
-Created a Legacy XRInput interface to automate the switch between 2018.1 and 2018.2 XRInput versions.

## [1.0.0-preview.8] - 2018-05-24
### Added
- Availability check to determine runtime support for ARKit.
- Normalize average brightness reading from 0..1

## [1.0.0-preview.5] - 2018-03-26

### This is the first release of the ARKit package for multi-platform AR.

In this release we are shipping a working iteration of the ARKit package for 
Unity's native multi-platform AR support.
Included in the package are static libraries, configuration files, binaries 
and project files needed to adapt ARKit to the Unity multi-platform AR API.
