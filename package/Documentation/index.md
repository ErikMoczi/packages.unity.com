# Unity Scriptable Build Pipeline

The Scriptable Build Pipeline (SBP) package allows you to control how Unity builds content. The package moves the previously C++-only build pipeline code to a public C# package with a pre-defined build flow for building AssetBundles. The pre-defined AssetBundle build flow reduces build time, improves incremental build processing, and provides greater flexibility than before.

If you are moving from using BuildPipeline methods to the SBP, see the [Usage Examples](UsageExamples.md) and [Upgrade Guide](UpgradeGuide.md).
