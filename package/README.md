# upm-package-template-HD

This template is a good starting point for people focused on high-end graphics that want to develop games for platforms that support Shader Model 5.0 (DX11 and above). This template utilizes the High Definition Scriptable Render Pipeline, a modern rendering pipeline that includes advanced material types and a configurable hybrid tile/cluster deferred/forward lighting architecture.
