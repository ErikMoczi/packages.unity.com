# About &lt;Lightweight Project Template &gt;

The Lightweight Project Template configures Project settings for Projects where performance is a primary consideration and projects that use a primarily baked lighting solution. 
This template utilizes the Lightweight Scriptable Render Pipeline, which is a single-pass forward renderer that decreases the draw call count on your project, making it ideal for lower-end hardware. 
This template also  includes the new Shadergraph tool, Post-Processing stack, several Presets to jump start development, and example content.

This Project Template uses the following features:

Lightweight Render Pipeline - For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ScriptableRenderPipeline/wiki">wiki</a> on the Scriptable Render Pipeline repository.
Shader Graph tool - This tool allows you to create shaders using a visual node editor instead of writing code. For more information on the Shader Graph, see the <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki">wiki</a> on the Shader Graph repository.
Post-processing stack - The Post-Processing Stack enables artists and designers to apply full -screen filters to scenes using an artist-friendly interface. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki">wiki</a>  on the Post-Processing GitHub repository.

*Note:* The Lightweight Scriptable Render Pipeline is currently in development, so consider it incomplete and subject to change (API, UX, scope). As such, it is not covered by regular Unity support. Unity is seeking feedback on the feature.
