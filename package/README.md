# Tiny Mode
This package contains all you need to start using Tiny Mode.

Tiny Mode enables you to create lightweight Web-based games using the Unity Editor.

# Prerequisites
## Unity 2018.3
This package requires Unity 2018.3 or later. It does not support previous versions. Get it [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update).

# Getting Started
## Open Unity
Open Unity and either create a new project or open an existing project.

Tiny Unity works *within* the context of a Unity project, so you can reuse assets between a Unity project and multiple Tiny Unity projects.

## Install This Package
Open the Package Manager window (__Window / Package Manager__), and check the __Show preview packages__ option under the __Advanced...__ button. Once the Package list is refreshed, you should see the __Tiny Mode__ package (identified as `com.unity.tiny`). Click on __Install__ to add it as a project dependency.

Once the package is installed, you should see a new __Tiny__ menu item in the Unity menu bar.

## Import the Sample Projects

Use __Tiny > Import Samples...__ to launch the interactive package importer. Sample projects are a great way to learn Tiny Mode.

## Open a Sample Project
To open sample projects, select __Tiny > File > Open Project__ and browse the __Assets/TinySamples__ folder. You can also double-click a `.utproject` asset in the Project window to open it in the Editor.

# Documentation
In the __Package Manager__ window, with __Tiny Mode__ selected, you have access to a __View documentation__ link that opens the package documentation for the current release.

This page contains the user manual, the Editor API reference, and the Runtime API reference.
