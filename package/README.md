# upm-package-template-3DLightweightVR

This template is a good starting point for developers focused on performance and VR projects that use a primarily baked lighting solution. This template utilizes the Lightweight Scriptable Render Pipeline, a single-pass forward renderer. Note that this project is designed to be used with a Virtual Reality device. Make sure you have the correct SDKs for the device you are using before using this template.
