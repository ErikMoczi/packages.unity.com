# Animation C# Jobs Samples

The **Animation C# Jobs** allow to modify the animation stream directly inside
the data flow of the animation tree. This feature is powered by the
**Playables**.

This package gives examples of how this feature could be used:

* SimpleMixer: Simple mix between two clips
* WeightedMaskMixer: Mix between two clips with a different weight for different parts of the avatar
* TwoBoneIK: Two-bone IK
* FullBodyIK: Full body IK

## Prerequisites

In order to play with the animation C# jobs, knowledge of C# and the Playable
system is required.
